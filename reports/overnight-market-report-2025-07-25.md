MORNING MARKET REPORT
For: Friday, July 25, 2025
Coverage Period: July 24 4:00 PM ET - July 25 9:30 AM ET
==============================================

**EXECUTIVE BRIEF**
Global markets are exhibiting cautious positioning ahead of the US open, with S&P 500 futures indicating a modestly higher start following mixed Asian sessions and stronger European trading. Technology sector leadership remains intact as validated by overnight XLK performance at $261.99, while defensive positioning in XLU ($84.29) and XLP ($81.30) suggests institutional hedging ahead of key economic releases.

**ASIAN MARKETS IMPACT**
Asian markets delivered mixed performance during the US overnight session, with the Nikkei 225 closing down 0.8% while the Hang Seng gained 0.6%. Technology sector spillover effects are evident in US ADRs, particularly semiconductor names, following stronger-than-expected Taiwan export data. The People's Bank of China's maintenance of key lending rates and injection of short-term liquidity supported regional risk assets, though concerns over property sector stress persist. Currency markets saw the USD/JPY stabilize around 142.50 after recent volatility, reducing immediate currency translation impacts for US multinationals. Australian markets outperformed on commodity strength, with base metals advancing 1.2% during Asian hours, supporting US materials sector positioning as reflected in XLB at $91.37. Cross-border flows indicate net buying from Asian institutions into US equities, particularly in technology and consumer discretionary sectors.
