U.S. futures point to continued strength at the open, with S&P 500 futures up 0.9% and NASDAQ futures gaining 0.5%. Today's economic calendar features initial jobless claims (consensus: 235K) and existing home sales data, both critical for Fed policy expectations.

Major earnings releases include Microsoft after the close, with cloud revenue growth and AI monetization in focus.
