**XLF (Financial Services)** edges lower by 0.09% to $53.07 as net interest margin concerns offset credit quality improvements. Regional banks face continued commercial real estate headwinds.

**XLV (Healthcare)** declines 0.27% to $135.76 on drug pricing pressures and regulatory uncertainty. Biotech subsector weakness weighs on broader healthcare sentiment.

**XLI (Industrials)** shows modest weakness at -0.07% to $153.47, with aerospace strength offset by construction equipment concerns amid slowing housing activity.
