Technology sector performance will be closely watched given overnight developments in Asian markets and recent earnings guidance updates. Financial sector stocks may experience volatility based on regulatory developments and interest rate expectations.

## RISK FACTORS TO MONITOR

Key risks for today's session include potential escalation of geopolitical tensions affecting energy markets, unexpected economic data releases that could shift Federal Reserve policy expectations, and continued volatility in currency markets that may impact multinational corporate earnings expectations. Additionally, any developments in international trade policies or regulatory announcements could create sector-specific volatility throughout the trading day.
