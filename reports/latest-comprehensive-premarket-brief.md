# COMPREHENSIVE PRE-MARKET NEWS BRIEFING
## Thursday, July 31, 2025

## AT A GLANCE

The overnight session has been dominated by a massive AI infrastructure investment announcement from tech giants and mixed earnings results from pharmaceutical leader Bristol Myers Squibb. The most significant development is the revelation that Meta, Microsoft, and Google are planning to deploy over $240 billion in AI infrastructure investments over the next two years, with analysts describing this as a "tsunami" that could power the fourth industrial revolution. This announcement has overshadowed other corporate developments and is expected to drive significant sector rotation into AI-related equities.

Meanwhile, Bristol Myers Squibb reported mixed Q2 results with revenue beating estimates at $12.27 billion but EPS missing consensus, leading to a cut in full-year earnings guidance. The pharmaceutical giant's struggles with generic erosion of legacy drugs highlight broader sector challenges. Significant insider trading activity has emerged across multiple sectors, with notable option exercises at A.O. Smith ($842K) and Visteon ($67K), while executive selling occurred at Darden Restaurants ($343K) and ReposiTrak ($132K). Microsoft's approach toward a $4 trillion market capitalization following strong Q4 earnings continues to lift technology ETFs, while Palantir faces heightened scrutiny ahead of its August 4 earnings report despite strong revenue growth expectations.

## US MARKET DEVELOPMENTS

The US market narrative overnight has been dominated by the technology sector's massive AI infrastructure investment announcement and mixed earnings results from key healthcare companies. Bristol Myers Squibb's Q2 results exemplify the challenges facing established pharmaceutical companies, with the company reporting revenue of $12.27 billion that exceeded estimates but earnings per share of $1.46 that fell short of the $1.58 consensus. The company's decision to cut full-year EPS guidance to $6.35-$6.65 while raising sales outlook to $46.5-$47.5 billion reflects the complex dynamics of generic erosion affecting legacy drug portfolios. Significant insider trading activity has emerged across multiple sectors, with A.O.
