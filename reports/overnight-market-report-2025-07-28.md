## TECHNICAL LEVELS

The S&P 500 futures face key resistance at 5,565 (61.8% Fibonacci retracement) with immediate support at 5,520 (20-day moving average). A break above 5,565 targets the July high of 5,589. Nasdaq 100 futures show bullish momentum above 19,800, with next resistance at 20,100 and support at 19,650. The Dow futures approach the psychological 41,000 level, with strong support at 40,500. VIX remains below the 17.5 threshold, indicating low fear levels. Options flow shows elevated call activity in technology names, with put/call ratios at 0.68 for SPY, suggesting bullish sentiment. Key intraday levels: SPX 5,547 (+0.4% from current), NDX 19,845 (+0.3%), and DJI 40,785 (+0.2%).

## RISK ASSESSMENT

Geopolitical risks remain elevated with ongoing tensions in Eastern Europe potentially affecting energy markets and global supply chains. Credit market stress indicators show benign conditions with the MOVE index at 95.2, below the 100 stress threshold. Market correlations remain stable with equity-bond correlation at -0.23, within normal ranges. However, concentration risk in mega-cap technology stocks poses systemic concerns, with the top 10 S&P 500 constituents representing 34.2% of index weight. Currency volatility has increased modestly, with the DXY showing higher intraday ranges. Tail risk considerations include potential Federal Reserve policy errors and unexpected inflation persistence, while systematic risks appear contained given strong corporate balance sheets and healthy consumer spending patterns.

## KEY TAKEAWAYS

Markets exhibit cautious optimism with US futures higher despite Asian weakness, supported by strong corporate earnings momentum and expectations for continued economic resilience. Primary risk factors center on Federal Reserve policy uncertainty and geopolitical tensions, while technology sector concentration remains a key vulnerability requiring monitoring.
