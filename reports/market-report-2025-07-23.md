Today's economic calendar features existing home sales data and the latest weekly jobless claims, both critical for Federal Reserve policy expectations. The housing market data will be particularly scrutinized given recent mortgage rate volatility.

Federal Reserve officials are scheduled to speak later today, with markets focused on any commentary regarding the recent inflation trends and labor market dynamics. Overnight developments in geopolitical tensions and commodity markets are providing mixed signals for risk assets. The dollar index remains elevated, creating headwinds for multinational corporations while supporting domestic-focused sectors. Treasury yields are holding steady in the 4.2-4.3% range for the 10-year, maintaining pressure on growth-sensitive sectors.

## PREMARKET MOVERS

**Top 10 Gainers**: Technology megacaps are dominating premarket gains, led by NVDA's exceptional 9.31% surge to $177.76, likely driven by AI-related developments or earnings optimism. GOOGL (+3.77% to $67.24) and NFLX (+3.68% to $222.12) are showing strong momentum ahead of potential earnings catalysts. TSLA's 6.59% jump to $89.79 suggests positive sentiment around electric vehicle developments or production updates.

This unusual dual listing suggests high volatility and conflicting signals in the technology sector.
