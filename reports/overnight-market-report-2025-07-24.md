Specific technical levels for gap-fill scenarios center on SPY 632-634 range and QQQ 562-565 resistance zone, with break-above levels suggesting continued institutional buying. Professional trading strategies should focus on gap-fade opportunities in individual names while respecting broader index momentum from futures strength.

## RISK ASSESSMENT FOR US OPEN

Volatility expectations remain elevated based on conflicting after-hours signals in major technology names, requiring careful position sizing and risk management protocols for opening positions. Geopolitical developments during closure period remained contained with no major escalations, supporting continued risk-taking in growth sectors. Economic data stability from major global economies reduces macro uncertainty, allowing focus on corporate fundamentals and sector rotation themes. Earnings developments from after-hours announcements create individual name risks but support broader sector themes in healthcare and technology. Liquidity conditions at 9:30 AM opening expected to be robust based on futures volume and institutional positioning, though technology names may experience elevated bid-ask spreads.
