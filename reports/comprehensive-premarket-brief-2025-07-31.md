## AT A GLANCE

Overnight markets are dominated by a historic cryptocurrency milestone as Bitcoin surpasses Amazon in market capitalization, reaching $2.4 trillion and cementing its position among the world's five most valuable assets. The technology sector continues to drive market sentiment with Meta, Microsoft, and Google planning a staggering $250+ billion AI infrastructure investment over the next two years, signaling the acceleration of the fourth industrial revolution.

**Critical Overnight Events:**
1. Bitcoin market cap reaches $2.4 trillion, overtaking Amazon, silver, and Alphabet to become fifth most valuable global asset
2. Tech giants Meta, Microsoft, and Google announce combined $250+ billion AI infrastructure investment plan over next two years
3. Bristol-Myers Squibb cuts 2025 EPS guidance to $6.35-$6.65 despite Q2 revenue beat, citing generic drug erosion pressures
4. Massive institutional options activity detected in Meta Platforms with 393 unusual trades, 43% bullish positioning
5. WuXi Biologics signals China pharmaceutical sector rebound with 16% revenue growth and 56% profit jump guidance

## EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

Overnight developments present a mixed but generally constructive market environment heading into Thursday's session. The cryptocurrency sector's historic milestone with Bitcoin overtaking Amazon in market capitalization underscores the continued institutional adoption of digital assets, while the technology sector's massive AI investment commitment from Meta, Microsoft, and Google reinforces the structural growth narrative driving equity valuations. However, pharmaceutical sector headwinds exemplified by Bristol-Myers' guidance cut highlight the ongoing challenges facing traditional industries, creating a bifurcated market environment that favors growth and innovation themes over value plays.

## US MARKET DEVELOPMENTS

The US market landscape overnight has been characterized by significant institutional positioning shifts and mixed corporate earnings results that highlight the divergent performance across sectors. Technology companies continue to attract substantial capital commitments, with the announcement of a combined $250+ billion AI infrastructure investment from Meta, Microsoft, and Google representing one of the largest coordinated technology investments in recent history. This massive capital deployment signals confidence in artificial intelligence as a transformative economic force and suggests continued outperformance for technology infrastructure and semiconductor companies. The pharmaceutical sector presents a more challenging picture, with Bristol-Myers Squibb's earnings results exemplifying the pressures facing traditional drug manufacturers as patent cliffs and generic competition erode legacy revenue streams despite overall revenue growth.

Options market activity reveals sophisticated institutional positioning, particularly in high-growth technology names where unusual trading volumes suggest significant capital deployment by hedge funds and institutional investors. The bullish positioning in companies like Meta Platforms, ServiceNow, and emerging nuclear energy plays like Oklo indicates continued appetite for growth stories despite elevated valuations. Corporate dividend announcements, including Willis Lease Finance Corporation's quarterly dividend declaration, demonstrate ongoing commitment to shareholder returns even as companies navigate uncertain economic conditions.

## ASIAN MARKET NEWS

Asian markets overnight have been influenced by positive developments in China's pharmaceutical sector and continued technology sector momentum. WuXi Biologics' strong profit guidance represents a significant positive signal for China's drug development industry, with the company projecting 16% revenue growth and a 56% profit increase for the first half of 2025. This performance suggests that Chinese pharmaceutical companies are successfully navigating regulatory challenges and benefiting from increased domestic and international demand for drug development services. The rebound in WuXi Biologics and other companies in the WuXi group indicates broader stabilization in China's biotechnology sector after several challenging years marked by regulatory uncertainty and geopolitical tensions.

The technology sector continues to drive regional market sentiment, with the massive AI investment announcements from US tech giants having positive spillover effects for Asian technology suppliers and partners.

## EUROPEAN MARKET NEWS

European markets are positioned to react to global technology sector developments and cryptocurrency market movements, with Bitcoin's historic market capitalization milestone likely to influence European digital asset and fintech companies. The Foresight Technology VCT results indicate continued activity in the venture capital and technology investment space, though specific details remain limited in the overnight reporting. European markets will be particularly sensitive to the AI investment announcements from US technology giants, as European technology companies and suppliers often benefit from increased global technology infrastructure spending.

The pharmaceutical sector developments, particularly Bristol-Myers' guidance revision, may have implications for European pharmaceutical companies facing similar patent cliff challenges and generic competition pressures. European biotech and pharmaceutical companies will be closely watched for similar guidance updates and competitive positioning relative to their US counterparts.

## GEOPOLITICAL DEVELOPMENTS

Geopolitical developments overnight have been relatively subdued, with market focus primarily on corporate and sector-specific news rather than major international tensions. However, the continued strength of Chinese pharmaceutical companies like WuXi Biologics suggests some stabilization in US-China commercial relationships within the biotechnology sector, which has been a source of tension in recent years. The company's strong guidance and international partnerships indicate that despite ongoing geopolitical uncertainties, commercial relationships in critical sectors like drug development continue to function effectively.

The cryptocurrency sector's milestone achievement with Bitcoin surpassing Amazon in market capitalization also has geopolitical implications, as it represents the continued institutionalization of digital assets despite regulatory uncertainties in various jurisdictions. This development may influence regulatory approaches to cryptocurrency across different regions as governments grapple with the growing economic significance of digital assets.

## CURRENCY & COMMODITY MARKETS

Currency and commodity markets overnight have been significantly influenced by Bitcoin's historic achievement of surpassing Amazon in market capitalization, reaching $2.4 trillion and establishing itself as the fifth most valuable global asset. This milestone represents a fundamental shift in the digital asset landscape and has implications for traditional currency markets, particularly as institutional adoption continues to accelerate. The cryptocurrency's explosive July rally demonstrates continued appetite for alternative assets amid ongoing concerns about traditional monetary policy and inflation dynamics.

The massive AI infrastructure investment commitments from major technology companies are likely to drive increased demand for various commodities, including rare earth elements, copper, and other materials essential for semiconductor and data center construction. This $250+ billion investment plan over the next two years represents a significant source of commodity demand that could influence pricing across multiple sectors.

## EARNINGS & CORPORATE DEVELOPMENTS

Corporate earnings and developments overnight present a mixed picture with significant sector-specific variations that highlight the divergent performance across different industries. Bristol-Myers Squibb's earnings results exemplify the challenges facing traditional pharmaceutical companies, with the company reporting Q2 revenue of $12.27 billion that beat estimates but earnings per share of $1.46 that missed the $1.58 consensus. More concerning for investors, the company cut its 2025 EPS guidance to $6.35-$6.65 while raising its sales outlook to $46.5-$47.5 billion, indicating margin pressure from generic drug competition and patent cliff dynamics affecting legacy products.

In contrast, the technology sector continues to demonstrate robust growth prospects, with the announcement of a combined $250+ billion AI infrastructure investment from Meta, Microsoft, and Google representing one of the largest coordinated technology investments in recent history. This massive capital deployment signals confidence in artificial intelligence as a transformative economic force and suggests continued strong earnings growth for technology infrastructure companies. WuXi Biologics provides a positive counterpoint in the pharmaceutical sector, with the Chinese company projecting first-half revenue growth of 16% and profit increases of approximately 56%, indicating successful navigation of regulatory challenges and growing demand for drug development services.
