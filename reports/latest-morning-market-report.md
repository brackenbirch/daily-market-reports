**Monday, July 28, 2025**

## EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

Global markets are showing cautious optimism following President Trump's announcement of a 15% tariff deal with the European Union, averting a potential trade war, though European reception remains mixed. Asian markets declined overnight amid profit-taking, while US futures point to a positive open ahead of this week's critical Federal Reserve meeting where Powell faces mounting pressure from multiple fronts.

## ASIAN MARKETS OVERNIGHT

Asian markets closed broadly lower despite the US-EU trade deal announcement. Japan's Nikkei 225 fell 1.14% to close at 38,720, weighed down by a stronger yen as USD/JPY retreated to 148.47 from Friday's levels above 149.50. China's Shanghai Composite dropped 0.64% to 2,945, while Hong Kong's Hang Seng declined 0.43% to 17,240 as investors remained cautious despite emerging market optimism. Australia's ASX 200 fell 0.38% to 8,095, led by mining stocks on commodity weakness. The People's Bank of China maintained its medium-term lending facility rate at 2.30%, signaling continued monetary accommodation. Corporate earnings were mixed, with Toyota reporting Q1 revenue of ¥11.84 trillion, beating estimates of ¥11.65 trillion, while BHP Billiton missed iron ore production targets.

## EUROPEAN MARKETS SUMMARY

European markets opened mixed as investors digested the implications of the US-EU tariff agreement. The FTSE 100 gained 0.3% to 8,245, supported by energy stocks following the EU's commitment to massive US LNG purchases. Germany's DAX rose 0.2% to 18,420, though industrial stocks faced headwinds from the 15% tariff structure. France's CAC 40 was flat at 7,580, with luxury goods makers under pressure. The Euro Stoxx 50 edged up 0.1% to 4,890. EUR/USD strengthened to 1.1617 as markets viewed the trade deal as removing uncertainty, while GBP/USD held steady at 1.3397. European economists expressed relief over ending "crippling uncertainty" but criticized the tariff framework as potentially damaging to long-term competitiveness. ECB officials remained silent ahead of this week's Fed decision.

## US MARKET OUTLOOK

US futures point to a modestly positive open with S&P 500 futures up 0.38% at 5,547, Nasdaq futures gaining 0.31% at 19,846, and Dow futures advancing 0.41% at 40,785. The market faces a critical week with the Federal Reserve's two-day meeting beginning Tuesday, where Powell confronts Trump administration pressure, internal Fed dissent, and concerns over elevated equity valuations. Key economic data includes durable goods orders and consumer confidence, both due Tuesday. Major earnings this week include Microsoft, Apple, and Amazon, with particular focus on AI spending and cloud growth. The VIX remains elevated at 16.8, suggesting underlying nervousness despite the trade deal relief. Pre-market movers include Tesla following Musk's confirmation as Samsung's unnamed $16.5 billion microchip client.

## FUTURES ANALYSIS

Index futures show coordinated strength following the trade deal announcement, with S&P 500 futures at 5,547.25 (+0.38%), indicating a gap-up open above the 5,540 resistance level. Nasdaq futures at 19,845.50 (+0.31%) suggest technology stocks may benefit from reduced trade uncertainty. Commodity futures are mixed: WTI crude oil gained 1.2% to $78.40 on the EU LNG deal, while gold retreated 0.4% to $2,385 as safe-haven demand waned. Natural gas futures surged 3.8% to $2.94 on European energy security themes. The dollar index strengthened to 104.2, pressuring emerging market currencies. VIX futures declined to 16.2, suggesting reduced hedging demand, though institutional positioning remains defensive ahead of the Fed meeting.

## RESEARCH HIGHLIGHTS

Goldman Sachs upgraded energy infrastructure stocks to overweight, citing the EU-US LNG agreement as a "structural tailwind" with price targets raised 15-20% across the sector. Morgan Stanley downgraded European industrials to underweight, warning that 15% tariffs could compress margins by 200-300 basis points. JPMorgan initiated coverage on AI semiconductor stocks with overweight ratings, highlighting Tesla's Samsung partnership as validation of automotive chip demand. Bank of America raised its S&P 500 year-end target to 5,800 from 5,600, citing reduced trade war risks, while Citigroup maintained its cautious 5,200 target on Fed policy concerns. Institutional flow data shows $2.8 billion in equity inflows last week, the largest since May, with technology and energy leading sector allocation.

Consumer Discretionary (XLY +0.93%) benefited from reduced tariff uncertainty, while Financials (XLF +0.70%) gained on rising rate expectations.

Sector rotation indicators suggest a shift toward cyclicals, with the Russell 2000 outperforming large caps by 80 basis points Friday, signaling renewed small-cap interest on domestic economic optimism.

## BONDS AND COMMODITIES

The 10-year Treasury yield rose 4 basis points to 4.28% as trade deal optimism reduced safe-haven demand, while the 2-year yield climbed 6 basis points to 4.52% on Fed hawkish expectations. The yield curve remains inverted at -24 basis points, though flattening pressure has eased. Investment-grade credit spreads tightened 2 basis points to 95 over Treasuries, while high-yield spreads compressed 5 basis points to 285. Gold declined to $2,385 (-0.4%) on dollar strength, while silver fell 0.8% to $28.40. Copper gained 1.1% to $4.32 on infrastructure optimism. WTI crude oil advanced 1.2% to $78.40, with Brent at $82.10, supported by the EU energy deal. Agricultural commodities were mixed, with wheat up 0.6% and corn down 0.3%.

## TECHNICAL LEVELS

The S&P 500 faces critical resistance at 5,540-5,550, with futures already testing this zone in pre-market trading. A sustained break above 5,550 targets the July high at 5,669, while support sits at 5,480 and 5,420. The Nasdaq confronts resistance at 19,850-19,900, with the 20,000 psychological level looming. RSI readings show the S&P 500 at 58.2 (neutral) and Nasdaq at 61.4 (approaching overbought). Options flow indicates heavy call buying in the 5,550-5,600 strike range expiring Friday, suggesting bullish positioning. The VIX testing support at 16.0 could signal further complacency. Key intraday levels: S&P 500 support at 5,520 (-0.5% from futures), resistance at 5,570 (+0.4%). Volume patterns suggest institutional accumulation above 5,530.

## RISK ASSESSMENT

Geopolitical risks have moderated following the US-EU trade agreement, though implementation details remain unclear and European skepticism persists. Credit markets show stability with investment-grade spreads near cycle lows, but high-yield energy credits face refinancing pressure. The VIX at 16.8 suggests complacency despite Fed uncertainty, with realized volatility below implied levels indicating potential for volatility expansion. Cross-asset correlations remain elevated, with equity-bond correlation at 0.65, limiting diversification benefits. Systemic risks include potential Fed policy error, with markets pricing only 25 basis points of cuts through year-end while economic data suggests more aggressive easing may be needed. Currency volatility in emerging markets poses contagion risks if dollar strength accelerates.

## KEY TAKEAWAYS

Markets are cautiously optimistic on reduced trade war risks, but this week's Fed meeting represents the primary catalyst with Powell facing unprecedented political and market pressures. The combination of elevated valuations, mixed economic signals, and policy uncertainty suggests heightened volatility potential despite current market complacency.
