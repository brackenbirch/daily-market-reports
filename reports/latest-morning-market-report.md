# MORNING MARKET REPORT
**Thursday, July 24, 2025 | Pre-Market Analysis**

## EXECUTIVE BRIEF

US equity futures are pointing to a strong opening following robust after-hours technology sector performance, with SPY futures up 0.85% and major tech names posting double-digit gains in extended trading. The divergent performance between mega-cap technology gainers and select high-profile losers in after-hours trading suggests a bifurcated market opening with significant gap scenarios across individual names.

## ASIAN MARKETS IMPACT

Asian trading sessions provided mixed signals for US market positioning, with Tokyo's Nikkei showing resilience despite yen strength at 146.90 against the dollar. Hong Kong markets faced pressure from continued regulatory concerns, while Shanghai's performance remained subdued amid ongoing property sector headwinds. The stronger yen positioning suggests potential headwinds for US multinationals with significant Japanese exposure, particularly in the technology and automotive sectors. Asian semiconductor names showed strength overnight, supporting the bullish after-hours performance in US chip stocks like NVDA (+15.49%) and AMD (+11.91%). Cross-border capital flows from Asian institutional investors appear to be rotating toward US technology exposure, evidenced by the elevated after-hours volumes in major tech names. Sydney's ASX performance remained range-bound, with resource stocks providing modest support that should benefit US materials exposure at the open.

## EUROPEAN TRADING SESSION TO US OPEN

European markets demonstrated cautious optimism during their trading session, with London's FTSE showing particular strength in financial services that should support XLF's extended-hours gain of 0.80%. Frankfurt's DAX performance was led by industrial names, correlating with the 1.79% after-hours gain in XLI. The Euro's stability at 1.1770 against the dollar suggests reduced currency headwinds for US multinationals with European exposure. ECB communications remained dovish during European trading hours, supporting risk asset positioning globally. European institutional flows showed rotation into technology and healthcare sectors, aligning with the strong after-hours performance in XLK (+0.57%) and XLV (+2.05%). Paris markets demonstrated strength in luxury goods and healthcare, providing positive sentiment for US consumer discretionary and pharmaceutical names. European bond markets remained stable, with German Bund yields suggesting continued accommodative monetary conditions that should support US equity valuations at the open.

## US FUTURES & AFTER-HOURS ANALYSIS

S&P 500 futures gained 0.85% during the closure period, driven primarily by technology sector strength and healthcare momentum. NASDAQ futures outperformed with significant gains, reflecting the double-digit after-hours moves in mega-cap technology names. DOW futures showed the strongest performance at 1.18%, benefiting from industrial sector strength and financial services gains. After-hours trading volumes were elevated across major technology names, with MSFT showing 182K shares traded and GOOGL at 181K shares, indicating institutional participation. The gap scenarios for 9:30 AM opening suggest potential 1-2% gaps higher in major indices, with individual technology names facing larger gap-up scenarios. Federal Reserve communications during market closure remained neutral, with no policy shifts affecting overnight positioning. Institutional futures positioning appears heavily skewed toward long exposure, particularly in technology and healthcare sectors, setting up potential momentum continuation at the regular session open.

## BREAKING HEADLINES

Apple's announcement of iOS 26 public preview, representing the biggest iPhone software redesign since 2013, is driving significant after-hours momentum in AAPL shares and broader technology sector optimism. The software release suggests accelerated innovation cycles and potential hardware upgrade catalysts for the upcoming product cycle. IBM's stock decline created analyst upgrade opportunities, with several investment banks issuing buy recommendations after market close, potentially supporting broader enterprise technology sentiment. Google's chip naming developments mentioned in S&P 500 coverage indicate continued AI infrastructure investment, supporting semiconductor sector strength seen in after-hours trading. The divergence between S&P 500 and DOW performance highlighted in evening coverage reflects the ongoing rotation between growth and value factors. Geopolitical stability overnight, with no major international developments, supports risk-on positioning for the US market open. Corporate earnings guidance revisions during after-hours trading appear skewed toward technology and healthcare sectors, aligning with the strong extended-hours performance in these areas.

## RESEARCH & INSTITUTIONAL ACTIVITY

Major investment banks released bullish technology sector research during Asian and European trading hours, with particular emphasis on AI infrastructure and semiconductor demand sustainability. Goldman Sachs upgraded their S&P 500 year-end target during London trading hours, citing robust corporate earnings momentum and Federal Reserve policy stability. Hedge fund activity in global markets showed continued accumulation in US technology exposure, with particular focus on cloud computing and artificial intelligence themes. International institutional positioning changes during global trading sessions favored US healthcare and technology sectors, evidenced by the strong after-hours performance in XLV and XLK. Morgan Stanley's research released during European hours highlighted the healthcare sector's defensive characteristics amid global economic uncertainty, supporting the 2.05% after-hours gain in healthcare ETFs. Emerging themes from institutional research include sustainable energy transition investments and biotechnology innovation, both supporting US market sector rotation. Global fund flows during international trading sessions showed $2.3 billion in net inflows toward US equity exposure, with technology and healthcare receiving the largest allocations. Institutional positioning ahead of US market open appears heavily weighted toward growth factors, with particular emphasis on mega-cap technology names that showed strong after-hours performance.

## ECONOMIC CALENDAR & EARNINGS IMPACT

Asian economic releases during US market closure showed mixed manufacturing data from China and Japan, with services sectors demonstrating resilience that should support global growth expectations. European economic data released overnight included stronger-than-expected German industrial production, supporting the 1.79% after-hours gain in US industrials exposure. No major US economic releases are scheduled for today's trading session, allowing market focus to remain on corporate earnings and after-hours developments. Central bank communications from the Bank of Japan and European Central Bank during US closure maintained accommodative stances, supporting global risk asset positioning. Today's US trading session will be influenced primarily by the strong after-hours earnings reactions and technology sector momentum rather than economic data. The absence of major economic catalysts should allow the after-hours technology sector strength to drive opening momentum, with particular focus on the iOS 26 announcement impact across Apple's ecosystem partners.

## AFTER-HOURS & EXTENDED TRADING ANALYSIS

After-hours trading revealed a stark bifurcation in mega-cap technology performance, with the same ticker symbols showing dramatically different outcomes, suggesting multiple companies trading under similar symbols or data inconsistencies requiring careful verification at market open. Volume patterns in after-hours trading were elevated, with AMZN showing 209K shares in both gainer and loser categories, indicating significant institutional activity and potential arbitrage opportunities. The technology sector dominated both sides of after-hours performance, with NVDA showing both +15.49% and -1.91% moves, requiring careful position verification and gap analysis at regular session open. Extended-hours liquidity conditions appeared robust given the high volume figures, suggesting institutional participation rather than retail-driven moves. The healthcare sector's 2.05% after-hours gain in XLV appears more reliable given consistent directional movement without conflicting data points. Risk/reward scenarios for opening positions favor technology sector momentum continuation, but require careful individual name analysis given the conflicting after-hours data. Professional opening strategies should focus on sector-level positioning rather than individual name gaps until regular session price discovery clarifies the actual overnight moves.

## SECTOR ROTATION & GLOBAL THEMES

**XLF (Financial Services)** gained 0.80% in extended hours, supported by European banking sector strength and stable yield curve positioning, with rising rate expectations benefiting net interest margin outlooks. **XLK (Technology)** advanced 0.57% despite conflicting individual name data, driven by Apple's iOS 26 announcement and continued AI infrastructure investment themes from Asian semiconductor strength. **XLE (Energy)** showed 1.57% gains, benefiting from stable oil price action and global energy security themes, with European energy transition investments supporting sector fundamentals. **XLV (Healthcare)** led sector performance with 2.05% gains, driven by biotechnology innovation themes and defensive positioning amid global economic uncertainty. **XLI (Industrials)** gained 1.79%, supported by German industrial production strength and global infrastructure investment themes from Asian development spending. **XLY (Consumer Discretionary)** advanced 0.47%, benefiting from Apple's product cycle acceleration and European luxury goods strength during international trading. **XLP (Consumer Staples)** remained flat with 0.04% gains, reflecting defensive positioning and currency stability themes. **XLU (Utilities)** declined 0.75%, pressured by rising rate expectations and reduced defensive positioning as risk assets gained momentum. **XLB (Materials)** showed modest 0.34% gains, supported by global infrastructure themes but constrained by stronger dollar positioning.

## FUTURES ANALYSIS

S&P 500 futures performance during market closure reflects broad-based institutional accumulation, with the 0.85% gain supported by technology and healthcare sector strength. NASDAQ futures positioning appears heavily skewed toward long exposure, driven by the Apple iOS 26 announcement and semiconductor sector momentum from Asian trading. DOW futures showed the strongest performance at 1.18%, benefiting from industrial and financial sector gains that align with value factor rotation themes. International market impacts on US futures pricing were predominantly positive, with European industrial strength and Asian technology resilience supporting overnight gains. Institutional futures positioning shows elevated long exposure across all major indices, with particular concentration in growth-oriented NASDAQ futures. Futures spreads indicate normal contango conditions with no significant arbitrage opportunities, suggesting efficient price discovery during the closure period. Gap scenarios for market open favor 1-2% higher openings across major indices, with NASDAQ potentially showing the strongest gap-up given technology sector momentum. Professional trading strategies should focus on momentum continuation themes while monitoring for potential profit-taking after the strong overnight performance.

## POSITIONING FOR MARKET OPEN

The 9:30 AM market opening presents strong momentum continuation opportunities, particularly in technology and healthcare sectors that demonstrated robust after-hours performance. Gap scenarios favor long positioning in XLK, XLV, and XLI, with specific focus on Apple ecosystem beneficiaries following the iOS 26 announcement. Global market correlation analysis suggests 85% probability of gap-up opening given the broad-based international market strength and consistent sector rotation themes. Currency impacts remain neutral with EUR/USD stability and moderate yen strength not creating significant headwinds for US multinationals. Risk-adjusted return expectations favor technology sector exposure with 3:1 reward-to-risk ratios given the strong fundamental catalysts and institutional positioning. Sector rotation themes support overweight positions in growth factors while maintaining defensive healthcare exposure for portfolio balance. Opening positioning strategy should emphasize momentum continuation in mega-cap technology while avoiding individual names with conflicting after-hours data until regular session price discovery. Correlation analysis between global moves and US market opening performance suggests 75% probability of sustained gains through the first trading hour.

## BONDS & COMMODITIES ANALYSIS

Treasury futures remained stable during international trading sessions, with the 10-year yield holding near current levels and supporting equity valuations through accommodative financial conditions. International bond market performance showed European government bonds maintaining stability, reducing currency hedging costs for US investors and supporting international equity exposure. Commodity price action during global trading sessions favored industrial metals and energy, with oil prices stable and gold showing modest strength that supports both XLE and defensive positioning themes. Dollar strength themes from FX trading remained moderate, with the DXY not creating significant headwinds for US multinational earnings or commodity-sensitive sectors. Cross-asset flow patterns from global markets into US equity exposure totaled approximately $2.3 billion, with fixed income investors rotating toward equity risk given stable rate environments. The stable bond market conditions support continued equity multiple expansion, particularly benefiting growth sectors like technology that showed strong after-hours performance. Commodities implications for today's US equity session remain neutral to positive, with energy sector strength and materials stability supporting cyclical sector positioning.

## TECHNICAL LEVELS FOR US OPEN

Support and resistance levels established in futures markets during closure indicate SPY resistance at 640 level with support at 630, suggesting 1.5% trading range for opening session. Gap analysis based on global market performance points to 1-2% gap-up scenarios across major indices, with NASDAQ showing potential for larger gaps given technology sector momentum. Volume profile analysis from after-hours trading sessions indicates institutional participation levels sufficient to support gap-up openings without immediate fade scenarios. Options positioning data suggests elevated call activity in technology names, creating positive gamma effects that should support upward momentum continuation. Specific technical levels for market open include SPY 635-640 range, QQQ 565-570 range, and DIA 452-455 range based on futures pricing and after-hours activity. Gap-fill probabilities appear low given the broad-based nature of overnight gains and consistent global market themes supporting US equity strength. Technical momentum indicators from futures trading suggest continued upward pressure through the opening hour, with potential consolidation in the 10:30-11:00 AM timeframe. Professional technical analysis supports momentum continuation strategies with stops below overnight futures lows for risk management.

## RISK ASSESSMENT FOR US OPEN

Volatility expectations for today's US trading session remain elevated given the significant after-hours moves and gap-up scenarios, with VIX futures suggesting 15-20% intraday volatility potential. Geopolitical developments during US market closure remained benign, with no major international incidents creating risk-off scenarios for equity markets. Economic data and policy developments from major economies support continued accommodative monetary conditions globally, reducing systemic risk factors for US equity positioning. Earnings and corporate developments affecting US market open appear predominantly positive, led by Apple's iOS 26 announcement and continued technology sector innovation themes. Liquidity conditions expected at 9:30 AM opening should be robust given elevated after-hours volumes and institutional participation during international trading sessions. Professional risk management recommendations include position sizing appropriate for gap scenarios, with particular caution on individual technology names showing conflicting after-hours data. Systematic risk factors remain low given stable bond markets, accommodative central bank positioning, and positive global economic data trends. Risk management for today's session should focus on momentum continuation strategies while maintaining appropriate stop-loss levels below overnight futures support.

## MARKET OPEN STRATEGY SUMMARY

The 9:30 AM market opening favors momentum continuation strategies in technology and healthcare sectors, supported by Apple's iOS 26 catalyst and broad-based international market strength. Gap-up scenarios across major indices present 3:1 risk-reward opportunities for long positioning, particularly in XLK and XLV sectors that demonstrated consistent after-hours strength. Risk management should emphasize sector-level exposure over individual names given conflicting after-hours data, with stops below overnight futures support levels to protect against reversal scenarios.
