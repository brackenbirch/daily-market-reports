## ASIAN MARKETS IMPACT

Asian trading sessions provided mixed signals for US market positioning, with Tokyo's Nikkei showing resilience despite yen strength at 146.91, while Hong Kong's Hang Seng faced pressure from regulatory concerns in the technology sector. Chinese markets demonstrated cautious optimism with Shanghai's composite gaining modest ground, though ADR positioning in US-listed Chinese stocks remains defensive ahead of the US open.

The EUR/USD stability at 1.1770 and GBP/USD strength at 1.3516 indicate reduced currency volatility concerns for US multinationals with significant European operations. European institutional flows appear to be positioning defensively in utilities and consumer staples while maintaining selective exposure to technology names with strong European market presence. German manufacturing data released during European hours showed modest improvement, providing support for US industrial names with significant European exposure. European bond markets demonstrated stability with yields remaining range-bound, suggesting reduced interest rate volatility concerns that could benefit US growth stocks at today's opening.
