## COMPREHENSIVE RISK ASSESSMENT

Primary risks include U.S. government shutdown implications for market operations and economic policy, potential cryptocurrency market volatility despite institutional inflows, and AI sector valuation corrections following Goldman Sachs warnings. Secondary risks encompass geopolitical developments affecting global trade, currency volatility from safe-haven flows, and earnings season disappointments in technology and growth sectors.
