## EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

U.S. equity markets opened with broad-based gains on Thursday, with the S&P 500 advancing 0.85% as technology and healthcare sectors led the rally amid positive earnings momentum.

The DAX advanced 0.9% to 18,650 as German manufacturing data showed signs of stabilization, while the FTSE 100 gained 0.6% to 8,290 supported by energy and financial sectors. The CAC 40 rose 0.7% to 7,580 ahead of key French inflation data. EUR/USD traded near 1.0850 as ECB officials continued to signal a measured approach to rate cuts, with markets pricing in a 25bp reduction at the September meeting. GBP/USD strengthened to 1.2920 following better-than-expected UK retail sales data. Political stability in France improved after successful parliamentary negotiations, while German business confidence surveys exceeded expectations, suggesting the eurozone's largest economy may be finding its footing after months of stagnation.

## US MARKET OUTLOOK

S&P 500 futures point to a positive open following strong overnight performance in technology sectors, with the index targeting a test of recent highs near 5,650. Key economic releases today include weekly jobless claims (expected 235K vs. 243K prior) and the Kansas City Fed manufacturing index. Major earnings announcements include Tesla after the close, with options markets pricing in a 7% move following results. Federal Reserve speakers include Governor Waller at 2:00 PM ET, with markets focused on commentary regarding the pace of potential rate cuts given recent inflation progress. Overnight developments supporting sentiment include better-than-expected earnings from several Asian technology companies and continued strength in semiconductor demand indicators. Treasury yields remain elevated with the 10-year near 4.25%, though the yield curve continues to normalize as short-term rates face downward pressure from dovish Fed expectations.

## PREMARKET MOVERS

## KEY TAKEAWAYS

Healthcare and energy sectors lead Thursday's advance as investors rotate toward value-oriented names while maintaining technology exposure ahead of key earnings results. Mixed premarket activity in mega-cap names suggests continued volatility as markets balance strong earnings momentum against elevated valuations and policy uncertainty.

## KEY HEADLINES AND RESEARCH

Institutional research focus centers on third-quarter earnings sustainability as companies navigate margin pressure from elevated labor costs and supply chain normalization. Federal Reserve policy recalibration remains a key theme, with markets pricing in 50bp of cuts by year-end despite resilient economic data. Geopolitical developments in Asia continue to influence semiconductor and technology supply chain positioning, while European energy security concerns support alternative energy infrastructure investments. Corporate credit markets show signs of stress in lower-rated issuers, prompting quality-focused positioning across fixed income portfolios. Currency volatility, particularly in emerging markets, creates headwinds for multinational earnings translations, while commodity price stabilization provides relief for input-cost sensitive sectors. Artificial intelligence infrastructure spending continues to drive selective technology outperformance, though regulatory scrutiny intensifies across major platforms.
