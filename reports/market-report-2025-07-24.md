## US MARKET OUTLOOK

S&P 500 futures point to continued strength following the positive opening, with technology earnings driving optimism ahead of key releases from major cloud computing and semiconductor companies. The market is positioning for today's initial jobless claims data and existing home sales figures, both critical for Federal Reserve policy expectations.

Several high-profile earnings announcements are scheduled, including major technology and healthcare names that could influence sector rotation dynamics.

## PREMARKET MOVERS

**Top 10 Gainers**: Technology dominance is evident with NVDA leading at +9.62% to $111.04, likely driven by AI infrastructure demand updates. NFLX surged 9.49% to $253.55 following subscriber growth acceleration reports.

**Top 10 Losers**: The same names appearing in both lists suggests significant volatility or data inconsistencies. However, analyzing the loser data independently: NVDA's -9.13% decline to $182.28 could reflect profit-taking after recent gains. GOOGL's -7.15% drop to $171.98 might indicate advertising headwinds. MSFT's -5.41% decline suggests cloud growth concerns.

The divergent moves indicate heightened volatility in mega-cap technology names, likely driven by earnings expectations and sector rotation dynamics.
