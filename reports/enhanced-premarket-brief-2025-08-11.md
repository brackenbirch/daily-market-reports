## US MARKET DEVELOPMENTS - ENHANCED COVERAGE

The US market faces significant headwinds from C3.ai's shocking revenue guidance revision, which has sent ripples through the broader AI and technology sector. The company's warning that Q1 revenue will come in at approximately $70 million—33% below Wall Street estimates of $104.1 million—has been attributed to leadership changes and CEO health issues that disrupted sales operations, resulting in steep operating losses. This development raises broader questions about AI sector valuations and execution capabilities across the space.

The mixed results initially caused AMD stock to crater before recovering, highlighting the continued volatility in semiconductor demand patterns.

The biotech sector shows positive momentum with Quantum BioPharma signing a manufacturing agreement for its oral drug formulation of Lucid-21-302 (Lucid-MS) as the company prepares for its upcoming Phase 2 multiple sclerosis trial, representing a significant advancement in the company's clinical development pipeline.
